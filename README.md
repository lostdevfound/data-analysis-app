# data-analysis-app
This webapp runs Fourier Analysis on the selected data. Fourier Analysis describes general functions as a sum of simpler trigonometric functions. The implemented   approach works well with continuous, non differentiable and discrete data. The process starts from synthesizing an analytical function which fits the data. The   generated function is decomposed into waves of different frequencies and amplitudes. Observing the magnitudes and frequencies one can find periodic patterns such as   seasonality and linear trends over time domain.


The project was created in my spare time purely for learning and experimenting with with mathematical concepts of Fourier Series. The algorithm implementation can be found on Github.
